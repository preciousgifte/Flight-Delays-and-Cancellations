# Flight Delays and Cancellations
 ### Telling story with data
A flight delay is when an airline flight takes off and/or lands later than its scheduled time. A cancellation occurs when the airline does not operate the flight at all for a certain reason. 
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015.

This dashboard shows the airline with the most cancellations, the month, and also the days of the week with the most cancellations.   
From the dashboard, it is seen that Southwest Airlines had the highest number of canceled flights and the major reasons were weather and airline respectively. Hawaiian Airlines Inc. had the fewest number of cancellations due to Airline/Carrier only. We can also see that the most cancellations happened in February with a total of 1058 and weather is mostly the reason for cancellation. On the other hand, September had the lowest cancellations, and Airline/Carrier was the major reason with a little difference. We can also see that most flight cancellations happened on Sunday and the lowest number of flight cancellations happened on Thursday. Day of the week and cancellation reasons were added as filters to get more analysis.
